                <p>Elegance Décor does wonderful work! We were completely wowed with how the ceremony and reception spaces were transformed with lighting, flowers, and designs that they gave us. Swetal, Ronak and Bhavik were great to work with. They were very attentive to our needs and made sure everything was set up perfectly the day of Sangeet and Wedding. We received a lot of compliments about the decor! I would definitely recommend them. Thank you for all the hard work. ”</p>

                <p>Elegance décor made my dream decorations a reality. For that, and so much more, I cannot thank them enough. Swetal and her team listened carefully to my vision and were able to transform a hotel ballroom into an exquisite place. I hired them to decorate my Sangeet, Wedding and Reception and they did so flawlessly. About six weeks before my wedding, I had a complete change of heart on my Mandap design. Swetal and I talked every night that week and she and the team came up with a brand new design for me. I was so appreciative of their flexibility and patience. When it came time for the big weekend, Elegance was able to transport all the decorations for the three events and 525 Chiavari chairs to Indianapolis on time! Each event was more beautiful than I could have imagined  and I was so thrilled to see how it all came together. A thousand times thank you to Swetal, Ronak and Bhavik for doing an amazing job!”</p>

                <p>Elegance was probably one of our favorite vendors to work with! Bhavik was extremely helpful and friendly throughout the whole planning process and always went out of his way to make sure our wedding and reception looked as beautiful as could, while still saying within our budget. They did a great job and our venue looked absolutely beautiful I would highly recommend working with them!”</p>

                <p>Elegance Decor made our special day everything we imagined it to be! I worked primarily with Swetal and the time and attention she gave to every detail was phenomenal. Throughout all my back and forth and mind changing she was extremely helpful and did everything she could to help me make my dream a reality. Our Mandap was gorgeous and the golden lanterns with the urli on the bottom just tied the entire vision together - we loved it! As for the reception, we both walked into the reception hall and our jaws dropped. There was such elegance to the room and it just took our breath away. Thank you so much to the Elegance Decor team! We would recommend them hands-down to anyone! ”</p>

                <p>Who helps a stranger fix their sari after being up all night making sure someone’s wedding/reception decorations are picture perfect? Yep… that would be Swetal. From my first encounter with Elegance Décor (at my friend Radhi’s wedding… which was GORGEOUS!), I could tell that they were going to be so nice and fun to work with during the crazy planning process. Since Pavan and I were engaged for 2 years, I changed my mind about my Mandap/Decorations about every day… and Swetal, Bhavik, and Ronak were so flexible, patient and creative when it came to making my pintrest dreams a reality. They worked really well with my wedding coordinator (Tara) and under pressure (flipping the wedding to reception space in under 3 hours).  I absolutely LOVED our Mandap and Reception, and we got so many complements on how tasteful, elegant and unique our décor was. Elegance Décor was amazing to work with and it’s evident that they are truly passionate about their work! xoxo ”</p>

                <p>Elegance Décor did the décor for Kandarp and my Mehndi, Sangeet, Wedding Ceremony, and Reception. Every time Kandarp and I walked into a room and saw the décor our eyes lit up. We couldn't help but smile ear-to-ear, and at one point I started jumping up and down because the décor made me so happy! Our guests were just as awe-struck. They constantly raved about the décor, saying that it was so impressive and beautiful. Without question, Ronak, Swetal, and Bhavik are a very creative and talented group. What sets them apart from other décor companies is that they treat their clients’ weddings like their own. Kandarp and I couldn’t believe how much attention they gave to the details of our wedding. They really took the time to understand what Kandarp and I wanted, and they spent countless hours working with us to make sure they delivered a product that not only met, but far exceeded our expectations. Most importantly, Elegance Décor was so fun to work with! Ronak, Swetal, and Bhavik are the sweetest people, and their service is impeccable. Hiring Elegance Décor was one of the best decisions Kandarp and I made, and we want to personally thank Ronak, Swetal, and Bhavik for creating a truly magical experience for us.”</p>

                <p>We had the pleasure of working with Elegance Décor for our wedding and reception. They did a fabulous job with all our wedding décor! Each detail was outstanding. They were very responsive and detail-oriented. We were looking to get some unique modern Indian wedding decor to match the ambience of our venue at the Trump. Our colors were pink and gold and Elegance did a fabulous job with turning our vision into reality! For the reception, we went with a classic, elegant red and silver theme and they did a fabulous job transforming the ballroom into a grand reception area filled with roses and crystals. They definitely went above and beyond to make our day run smoothly inspite of the tight schedule. All our guests are still raving about our wedding decor and we have only Elegance Décor to thank for this! They definitely lived up to our expectations and we would highly recommend them to anyone planning a wedding in and around the Chicago area. Keep up the good work!”</p>
