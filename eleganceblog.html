Oh Baby! It’s Been A Long Time...</div> 
        <p><img class="blog1pic" class="allimages" src="babyblogpic.jpg">

<h4>It’s been a while!  In the midst of a super busy wedding season and tons of OB Gyn appointments, it’s hard to believe that it’s been almost 6 months since my last blog.  This time I have a great excuse!  Our Elegance Décor family has grown with the addition of my baby girl.  I can’t believe it’s been 2 weeks since we were blessed with my little angel!  
<br><br>
I sit here writing this blog as I finally catch a breath as she is taking a nap!  Being a new parent is tough, but I must say it’s nice to get 2 weeks off from the regular hustle and bustle of events.  I have been catching up on reading and exploring events around the world through magazines and the web in between the non-ending diaper changes and feedings. Boy, am I inspired from the great work that’s being done by some amazing designers around the world!  I know, I am suppose to nap when the baby does, but I just can’t help but stay connected to and get inspired by design.
    <br>
<br>
As we are at the tail end of the 2016 wedding season, I already can’t wait for 2017 to come!  We worked with some amazing couples this past year and did some amazing events! I can’t wait to share some of our work from 2016 in the coming months…for now, I will leave you with a picture of our newest addition to the Elegance Décor family, Isharya. BTW…I think it’s time for another diaper change!
    <br><br>

P.S.  Yup, I had to incorporate fresh flowers in her picture! ;-) </h4>

Design board - Spring is in the air!</div> 
        <p><img class="blog2pic" class="allimages" src="Spring%20Palette.png">

<h5 id="springblog">Spring is in the air!  That's correct.. It's officially the first week of Spring! That means it's the start of the wedding season as well! 
<br><br>
In the spirit of this new season, I put together a design board that will surely bring that feeling of fresh garden breeze to your wedding. Flowers are your best friends around this time. There are so many varieties to choose from! My personal favorites are peonies, ranunculus, lilacs, tulips, and garden roses!  Combining brighter spring florals with neutral sheer fabrics such as champaign or white create a light and airy look.
<br><br>
The Groom can definitely make a fashion statement with a tuxedo in lighter color tones such as light grey or blue.  Groomsmen can compliment him with a tan/beige tux paired with a white shirt. Boutonnieres made with bright colored flowers such as ranunculus or spray roses are a perfect embellishment.
<br><br>
There are so many ways to go about styling a bride for a spring wedding! Floral prints in lehenga or duppatta can create a perfect look for a garden wedding.  Chiffon fabrics or pastel tones are also suitable for the season. Bridesmaids can wear sarees in different shades of a color to create an ombre effect. How about going from Coral to peach to blush OR  lavender to periwinkle to lilac?  Spring colors are oh so fun to play with as the options are endless to how you can create that one unique design that fits your style for your big day!  </h5>

A Sophisticated Color Palette</div> 
        <p><img class="blog1pic" class="allimages" src="blush%20pink%20blog.jpg">

<h4 id="blushblog">Most of my brides come in with a clear cut vision of their color palette for the wedding ceremony. However, more often than not, they are unsure about their reception colors.  Why? Reception decor is often under-researched by brides in the beginning phase of decor planning.  Most brides also want to stick around traditional or warmer tones for weddings, which makes it easy to narrow down the colors/themes for the ceremony.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the world is your oyster when it comes to Receptions!  It's hard to narrow down on a certain theme when the possibilities are endless. I recommend that it's better to first determine the overall ambiance you want for the evening. Do you see this evening event as formal, semi casual, or completely laid back?  I believe reception design is the best setting to reflect the couple's personality. There are no rules, so we can let our imagination take over and create a design that truly reflects the newly weds. 
<br><br>
Colors are Oh So important when it comes to setting the mood for the evening!  Here is a design palette that I put together with the colors- Navy &amp; Blush.  I am in love with these colors right now! When put together, these create a perfect harmony that reflects sophistication &amp; elegance.  Bringing together blush colors through floral create a soft feel to the event space while adding Navy through linens and accents for tablescapes creates a bold statement.
<br><br>
These are also great colors for bride &amp; groom's attire. You don't have to match with your decor, but with these colors..why not!  Pale pink lehenga is feminine yet classy. Navy tux adorned with a blush boutonniere detail creates a polished look that radiates sophistication. I am in LOVE with this fresh new color palette for 2016 and can't wait to design with it!

Bring On The Colors!</div> 
        <p><img class="blog2pic" class="allimages" src="sangeetblogpic1.jpg">

<h5 id="sangeetblog">Hey guys! Long time no see! Today I wanted to share some great tips for decorating  a Mehndi/Sangeet Night. For those who do not know, Indian weddings tend to be a multiple day affair. This is one of the reasons that Indian weddings become such grand celebrations. Generally, throughout 3-4 days, there are various events that take place. Personally, one of my favorite events is the Sangeet. Why? Because, it’s a casual night full of dancing, eating, and music! But let’s be honest, everyone knows my ultimate favorite part is always going to be the colorful décor. One of the best parts of coming up with a sangeet backdrop is the freedom to get as creative with colors as you want. There are no rules! Personally, my favorites are bright colors such as yellows, pinks, blues, greens, and purples! 
<br><br>
Another great idea would be to put elements such as umbrellas and seat cushions around the room. It gives guests a place to relax & sit while also adding more glitz to the areas around the room other than the backdrop. 
    <br>
<br>
There are many couples that decide to combine their Mehndi and Sangeet night. Most likely, the bride will be sitting the majority of the time, at least until the mehndi dries, so I would make the décor around her really stand out. One of my favorite suggestions is adding a swing for her to sit on. It adds a depth in the décor that a couch or chair cannot quite do. This also become a great spot for you take pictures with your friends and family. 
    <br><br>

No matter how you choose to decorate your Sangeet night, it’s definitely going to be a night you will never forget. Hopefully these tips get you guys a little bit closer to your dream wedding!) </h5>

OMG, I did not COPY her wedding!</div> 
        <p><img class="blog1pic" class="allimages" src="image%20of%20identical%20wedding.jpg">

<h4 id="copyblog">Here is a situation many of our brides dread…Either they love similar things that they saw at a friend’s or relative’s wedding but do not want them to think she copied them or a friend or a relative is trying to steal their ideas for their own wedding.  The fear of copying or being copied keeps them from truly creating a design that they love and wasting energy over something very miniscule. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  If you feel someone has copied your ideas take that as a compliment and feel happy about it!  I love it when I show the décor from my wedding and brides get inspired by the design and want to incorporate it into their décor. It truly makes me happy!   On the other hand, the biggest fear most of our brides have is them using similar elements that their sister, cousin, or friend had at their wedding.  Here it is very important to consider that the design is in the details.  Just because you use the same color palette doesn’t mean your wedding will look the same.  Just because your cousin used a fabric mandap doesn’t mean that yours cannot look completely unique.  The trick is to incorporate the elements you like and then have your designer create a unique look for you.   I remember a bride telling me she really wanted a S’mores Bar at her wedding but her friend’s wedding was before hers and she took that idea.  Now think about being a guest at both of these weddings.  Would you really care if you got a chance to eat S’mores again?!?!   I know I wouldn’t complain!  There are reasons for certain things being traditions in wedding. It's because they were amazing ideas at one point that had to continue..  
    <br>
<br>
At the end of the day weddings are not a competition to be the most unique party you have ever thrown.  They are a day that represents your love for each other and an occasion to share with all the people that you care for.   From my years of experience, I think the happiest brides are the ones that can look beyond these types of diversions and embrace the true meaning of the day that signifies the new phase of their life.

Head Table! Who Knew There Were So Many Options?</div> 
        <p class="higher" id="headtableblogslide"><img class="blog1pic" class="allimages" src="headtablepic.jpeg">

<h1 id="headtableblog">During our initial consultations, the one question that stumps most of our couples is “Who’s sitting on the head table?!”  Unless this was discussed before, it usually turns into a long conversation about “should it be just us?”, how to keep both sides even, who will be offended if they aren’t included, and how to place everyone without it looking like one long never ending table!
Luckily for our couples, we have done pretty much every type of stage arrangement that there possibly could be!  It doesn’t have to be a difficult decision, and there are ways to make sure everyone feels important on your big day!  Let’s walk through the pros and cons of each configuration.   
<br><br>
<b>Only Sweetheart Table (keeping it simple with only the bride and groom on the stage) </b>
 <br>
Pros:<br>
All the attention goes to the bride and groom, Avoids having to think of who to put at the head table, Allows family members to interact with other guests (rather than being glued to the stage!), You can make your loved ones feel special with special tables set off the stage (see my blog on table layouts for some ideas!)<br>
Cons:<br>
You don’t get to share the stage with all the important people in your life, Not the best option for couples who don’t like the limelight<br>
 
Designs:<br>
Sofa setup (dinner off the stage), Sofa setup with a table in front for dinner, Decorated sweetheart table – specialty linens/floral/ect., Acrylic table with acrylic chairs<br><br>

    <b>Sweetheart table with Separated tables for the family<br></b>
 
Pros:<br>
Separate tables allows you to still have a special sweetheart sofa or table setup, You get to share the stage with your loved ones<br>
Cons:<br>
You have to try to balance out guests from the bride and grooms side with some configurations, Need to make sure not to offend anyone by leaving them out!<br>
 
Designs:<br>
Any of the Sweetheart options listed above with:<br>
1 long table at the base of the stage (reduces issues with keeping even bride/groom guests counts), Multi-tiered setup with 4 separate tables or 2 long tables (sweetheart setup on top tier), 2 separate tables (bride and groom side)<br><br>

    <b>One long head table</b>   <br>
 
Pros:<br>
Great for the couple who doesn’t want to have all the attention on them<br>
Cons:<br>
Long Table could make getting to your seat and out difficult, Need to have an even bride/groom guest count; otherwise they won’t be in the center of the table!<br>
Designs:<br>
For one long head table, we usually use specialty linens and decorate the table with swags, floral, long lower riser type pieces.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of different options to consider!  It can seem difficult to make a decision, but working through the list of pros/cons will help you decide what’s the most important.  We can help you create a beautiful setup no matter what you decide!  Take a look at some of the work we’ve done in the past!

Designing With Nature - An Outdoor Ceremony in Chicago</div> 
        <p><img class="blog2pic" class="allimages" src="outdoorceremonypic.jpg">

<h5 id="outdoorblog">An outdoor ceremony is a dream for many of our Midwest brides. There are so many factors that you need to plan for an outdoors wedding in the Midwest! I will need to write a whole other blog for that.  Today, I wanted to talk about creating a ceremony design that compliments and doesn’t compete with the beauty of nature.  I am going to use a wedding that is close to my heart as it is our long time friends, Radha &amp; Praseen’s, wedding.  The wedding took place in front of a beautiful lake surrounded by greenery. Believe it or not, this unique venue is the outdoor ceremony area of The Westin in Itasca!  As the backdrop of her venue is already adorned with so much natural beauty, we decided to go with minimalism and pick up natural elements that complimented the outdoors. Radha wanted to make sure that our design blended with and enhanced the surroundings.  We went with birch wood branches to create the mandap.  Then we added in soft touches through white chiffon fabric draping that played beautifully with the summer wind. We added in succulents and greenery accents on the branches to bring them to life.   We brought in the summer feel through soft colors such as sage, peach, and dusty green through fresh flowers arranged in vintage cages.  Finally, the aisle was kept modest with spring blooms and baby’s breath in mason jars hanging off of Sheppard’s hooks.  We loved the simplicity of this wedding and how the ceremony setting just became part of the surrounding.  We hope you like it too!

It’s a Once In A Lifetime Thing, But It Doesn’t Have to Be Stressful!</div> 
        <p><img class="blog1pic" class="allimages" src="stressfulpic.jpg">

<h4 id="stressblog">Yes, I am talking about weddings!  When starting wedding planning, there is always a tremendous amount of pressure that we create for ourselves.  You want everything to be perfect!  After all, you are only planning on getting married once.  Yes, I know it is not what always happens, but at least that’s what the plan is.  Now that this BIG event is taking place just once, I must choose all the things that are the BEST! That “best” is the start of stress for most brides and grooms to be.  I wanted to write about this as this is something I can relate to as I was planning my wedding 5 years back.  Luckily, I quickly learned that the more important thing was that I made choices that I was happy with and stuck to them and did not continue to search for something better.  There are a million things that have to get done before the big day and being indecisive can only add to your stress.  I am proud to say that Ronak  (my husband) and I were pretty good at decision-making.  We did our research on vendors through web or referrals and met with 1-2 vendors in each category, and were able to decide if they would match our personality and provide our vision for the day.  Our dream list of what we wanted in the wedding was big, but we were also honest with our time, budget, and resources to quickly make cuts where needed to continue to be stress free as we planned for our big day.  However, there are certain things that I look back to and laugh about today.  I remember we had not made our programs and we had 2 days until our wedding festivities started.  I was adamant on how I wanted  three gems stuck on each program for embellishment instead of one gem that my husband had suggested to save time.   My cousin and I stayed up all night making these, but I don’t think anyone would have thought they were any less pretty if there was one gem on them!  Yes, all of us have those “bridezilla” moments!  The reason I wanted to write about this topic is that as I meet many brides through our business, I have observed that the happiest couples are the ones that don’t get stuck on little details if time/budget doesn’t allow them.  A lot of times I see our couples having this realization a couple months or a month before their big day as things start to pile up at the end.  I think starting off wedding planning knowing that letting go of little things will not make any difference on how your guest perceive your wedding and even your happiness on the day of can really help you stay stress free through the long process of wedding planning.  After all, weddings are a celebration and so should be the planning process!

It's All About the Layout!</div> 
        <p><img class="blog2pic" class="allimages" src="Table%20Types.jpg">

<h5 id="tableblog">We often get asked, “How do I make my reception space more interesting?  How can I take it from a normal party to an extravagant event?”  There are many ways to do this with décor but one of the most cost effective ways we suggest is with the table shapes and room layout!  Your reception venue will most likely have a variety of different table types (round, squares, and rectangles).  These can be used to create unique layouts that your guests have never seen before! The table layout can be used to define the purpose of the room, create room dividers, and even to create a great aisle for you to make your big entrance! As your decorator, we can create simple to lavish centerpieces to compliment the layout.  Repetitive smaller floral, candles, and vases for long tables; large trees or crystal pieces for the center of X tables or hollow tables; and even hanging centerpieces for square and round tables!

<h4 id="dreamyblog">"Pinks, purples, &amp; raspberry!" said Sonia with excitement when we asked her what colors she envisioned for her wedding.  "I want the cermony to have  a dreamy feel". This was an exciting color palette for us!  However, the challenge was how do you balance all these vibrant colors while also keeping that elegant dreamy feel for the ceremony.  We decided to go with soft white fabrics and bringing in these colors as accents through flowers &amp; lighting.  The mandap fabric was kept sheer and the aisle was adorned with lots of candles giving it that 'Oh so Dreamy' ambiance.  The flower arrangements were made with shades of pinks, purples, &amp; raspberry. The lighting was kept in pink blush tones to bring it all together...

<h4 id="gothicblog">Hi! I’m Bhavik – Co-Owner and Chief Operating Officer of Elegance Décor!  Apart from leading how we operate and execute our events, I love working with our clients and creating custom designs.  I’ve taken multiple art and design courses and am an engineer as well.  We meet people that have a vast array of ideas and visions for their wedding or special event.  Most of the time, they want their event to be different and stand out from all other weddings.  The best part of our job is working with these different ideas and creating new and innovative designs for centerpieces, mandaps, and backdrops...
<br><br>
One of my favorite reception backdrops that we’ve designed is this custom candle and chandelier wall.  The client wanted to have a gothic chic look so we worked with black, white, and red as a base color theme.  The chandeliers and candles really added to the Royal-ness of the reception and played to the theme perfectly!  We brought in the "gothic" feel thorugh tall wrought iron posts, chandeliers, and cages as centerpieces. The sweetheart table was also a custom vintage coffee table we found and refurbished.  Finding ornate vintage furniture and painting it a bold solid color to match the theme is a great way to add a modern flair to any event. 
<br><br>
Look for more of my favorite designs and ideas to come on future blogs!

<h4 id="copyblog">Here is a situation many of our brides dread…Either they love similar things that they saw at a friend’s or relative’s wedding but do not want them to think she copied them or a friend or a relative is trying to steal their ideas for their own wedding.  The fear of copying or being copied keeps them from truly creating a design that they love and wasting energy over something very miniscule. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  If you feel someone has copied your ideas take that as a compliment and feel happy about it!  I love it when I show the décor from my wedding and brides get inspired by the design and want to incorporate it into their décor. It truly makes me happy!   On the other hand, the biggest fear most of our brides have is them using similar elements that their sister, cousin, or friend had at their wedding.  Here it is very important to consider that the design is in the details.  Just because you use the same color palette doesn’t mean your wedding will look the same.  Just because your cousin used a fabric mandap doesn’t mean that yours cannot look completely unique.  The trick is to incorporate the elements you like and then have your designer create a unique look for you.   I remember a bride telling me she really wanted a S’mores Bar at her wedding but her friend’s wedding was before hers and she took that idea.  Now think about being a guest at both of these weddings.  Would you really care if you got a chance to eat S’mores again?!?!   I know I wouldn’t complain!  There are reasons for certain things being traditions in wedding. It's because they were amazing ideas at one point that had to continue..

At the end of the day weddings are not a competition to be the most unique party you have ever thrown.  They are a day that represents your love for each other and an occasion to share with all the people that you care for.   From my years of experience, I think the happiest brides are the ones that can look beyond these types of diversions and embrace the true meaning of the day that signifies the new phase of their life.
