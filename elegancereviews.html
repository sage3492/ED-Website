                <p>Elegance Decor turned our venue into a place that only exists in fairytales! From the very beginning, they were very easy to work with. Always responsive to emails, helpful with keeping us within our budget, and of course their creativity and attention to detail is out of this world! I mainly worked with Swetal for my wedding events. She was really patient and listened to what I wanted for each event. For the wedding I wanted an ethereal feel and I was blown away by the GORGEOUS flowers, especially the fresh floral chandelier hanging from the ceiling! For the reception, I wanted a romantic feel with lots of candles. She custom ordered a tree which would hold hundreds of candles and it was the center of a lot of our guests' pictures. You can truly go to Elegance Decor with any idea or thought, and they are able to deliver it. You can tell that they really have a talent and passion for what they do! It's been months since our wedding and people still talk about the decor and how amazing it was. Even my photographer who does so many weddings a year said ours took the cake for best decor she has seen at a wedding! In addition to being great at what they do, they are probably the sweetest people I know. They would text me during my wedding week to see how I was doing and make sure I was having fun. This just serves as a testament to how kind and generous they really are! I highly recommend them to all our friends and family; thank you for all your help!Do yourself a favor and choose Elegance Decor for your next event; you will not be disappointed!!”</p>

                <p>Planning a wedding is already a very stressful task, let alone Indian weddings with multiple events. Swetal was amazing and really took the time to sit and go through everything I've imagined my wedding events to be. Thank you guys so much for transforming our venue to the colorful, vibrant, and magical place to celebrate our wedding events. Looking back at the pictures and videos makes us realize how gorgeous everything looked. We still remember the feeling of first walking in & seeing our vision come to life!!! So surreal! Each detail from backdrop, center pieces, flowers, candles, etc were so "Elegantly" decorated around the room to create the authentic wedding feel. Highly recommend Elegance Decor to do your events!!!!!”</p>

                <p>Elegance Decor did an exceptional job for my wedding decor. Although I was located in Cleveland and was planning a wedding in Iowa, they made the entire process so simple. I was able to have phone meetings where I described what I envisioned along with some special features that I wanted to be included on my big day! With my requests, the team was able to develop a perfect backdrop for my wedding! It was better than what I had imagined. Their attention to detail, flexibility and constant communication with the client made this process very simple. I would highly recommend their expertise in wedding decor to anyone! Thank you Elegance Decor for making my wedding day so memorable!”</p>

                <p>After meeting with multiple decorators for my wedding, I selected Elegance Decor based on their friendliness, professionalism, and, above all, unique approach to Indian wedding decor. Swetal worked with me to help develop my ideas and provide thoughtful recommendations, which was a huge help. On my wedding day, my husband and I were so impressed at how well Elegance had put together our decor. Everything from the mandap, backdrops, flowers, and color palette were unique, beautiful, and even better than I had envisioned! I loved that the wedding and reception had two very different looks. I would highly suggest Elegance Decor to anyone looking for a partner to bring a fresh approach to their wedding.”</p>

They were so accommodating when it came to meetings and were always able to work around work schedules and always made us a priority even though I am sure they were incredibly busy during wedding season. They were always so helpful in making decisions when it came to the look and feel of our wedding so we got exactly what our vision was. Fast forward to the week of the wedding.

                <p>Elegance Decor left me in awe on my wedding day.  Everything that I wanted for my wedding and reception was made into reality.  When I walked into the venue for the wedding I was amazed at how well everything was executed.  There were times I told Swetal that I trust her and whatever she decides I'll be okay with, it was perfect.  The reception, I have no words to describe the decor for my reception.  I walked into the venue and I just stopped, I had never seen anything so beautiful.  I have to say, this was by far the best reception decor that I have seen, not saying that because it was mine.  Swetal went above and beyond for me on the day of the wedding.  She called my husband, Nil, that day to let him know that something was missing for the reception decor, the wow factor that we were looking for.  Nil asked Swetal to touch base with my sister since I didn't have my phone on me and she explained the situation to my sister and provided a suggestion.  I am so grateful that Swetal made that phone call, her last minute touch was amazing.  We are still getting compliments about our decor.  I highly recommend Elegance Decor for any occasion.  Everyone at Elegance Decor is easy to work with and they come up with unique designs to fit your taste.  Once again, thank you for everything!!”</p>
